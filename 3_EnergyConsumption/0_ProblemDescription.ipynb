    "Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, the goal is to minimize the total cost of energy consumption for a hotel over a single day while maintaining guest comfort and respecting operational constraints. The hotel has several rooms, and for each room, a temperature setpoint must be determined for every hour of the day. The key factors that influence energy consumption and costs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Environmental Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside Temperature: The outside temperature varies throughout the day (modeled using a sinusoidal pattern with random fluctuations).\n",
    "Room Orientation: Each room has an orientation factor (e.g., south-facing rooms may require more cooling due to increased sunlight).\n",
    "Door Opening Events: Randomly simulated events where doors might be left open, increasing energy consumption.\n",
    "Occupancy and Comfort:\n",
    "When a room is occupied, it is important to keep the temperature close to a desired comfort temperature (for example, 22.5°C). Deviations from this target incur a penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy Pricing:\n",
    "Energy cost is not constant throughout the day or year. A price schedule simulates hourly energy costs that vary depending on the month (e.g., winter months may have higher energy prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to design an optimal schedule (i.e., setpoints for each room at every hour) that minimizes the total energy cost (in EUR), while applying penalties for any violations of temperature range constraints or deviations from comfort during occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Chromosome Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our genetic algorithm framework, each solution is represented by a single one-dimensional array (chromosome). The details are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure:\n",
    "The chromosome is a 1D NumPy array of length:\n",
    "\n",
    "NUM_ROOMS×TIME_SLOTS\n",
    "NUM_ROOMS×TIME_SLOTS\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if there are 10 rooms and 24 hourly time slots, the chromosome will have 240 genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gene Meaning:\n",
    "Each gene represents the temperature setpoint for a specific room at a specific time slot. The mapping is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Room index: i // TIME_SLOTS\n",
    "Time slot: i % TIME_SLOTS\n",
    "where i is the index in the 1D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowed Range:\n",
    "Every gene is a continuous (floating point) value that must lie within the interval \n",
    "[𝑀𝐼𝑁_𝑇𝐸𝑀𝑃,𝑀𝐴𝑋_𝑇𝐸𝑀𝑃]\n",
    "[MIN_TEMP,MAX_TEMP]. For example, if the allowed range is from 20°C to 25°C, each gene’s value is between these two limits.\n",

    "Fitness Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness function evaluates the quality of a given solution (chromosome) by computing the total energy cost in EUR. This cost is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy Consumption Calculation:\n",
    "For each room and time slot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature Difference: The difference between the chosen setpoint and the outside temperature is computed.\n",
    "Heating: If the setpoint is higher than the outside temperature, energy is required for heating.\n",
    "Cooling: If the setpoint is lower, energy is used for cooling.\n",
    "Base Consumption: A fixed amount of energy (base consumption) is added.\n",
    "Modifiers:\n",
    "Orientation Factor: Each room’s energy consumption is adjusted based on its orientation.\n",
    "Door-Open Factor: Energy consumption is increased if the room’s door is open.\n",
    "Finally, the hourly energy consumption is multiplied by the corresponding hourly energy price (simulated via a price schedule that depends on the month).\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalties:\n",
    "To ensure feasible and comfortable solutions, penalties are added:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature Range Violations: A high penalty is applied if any setpoint falls outside the allowed temperature range.\n",
    "Occupancy Comfort: When a room is occupied, any deviation of the setpoint from the desired comfort temperature (e.g., 22.5°C) incurs an additional penalty.\n",
    "The overall fitness is the sum of the energy cost and all penalties. Lower fitness values indicate better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is implemented in a vectorized manner for efficiency and is called simply as fitness(chromosome).\n",
